SYNOPSIS:
Tools to detect known web service/website security weaknesses that we face on CTF game and
help us to mitigate those before other teams.
This application discover vulnerabilities arising from misconfiguration or flawed programming 
within web-based services such as web servers, websites, remote shells, etc. 

DESCRIPTION
In the CTF challenge, each team has a VM with couples of pre-installed services that have
intentionally built-in security bugs/flaws.
The purpose of this tool is to scan the local system in order to find those vulnerabilities.
By running this tool locally we can detect our vulnerabilities and patch them before other
teams could find and exploit.
This tool scan all open ports and static source code in the local machine for these type of
vulnerabilities/risks:

1. XSS (Cross-site scripting)
2. SQLi (SQL injection)
3. XXE (XML External Entities)
4. RCE (Remote Code Evaluation)
5. LFI (Local File Inclusion)
6. RFI (Remote File Inclusion)
